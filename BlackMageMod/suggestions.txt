Look, I know the only reason you downloaded this was to cosplay, so I'm here to give you some tips on how to Black Mage well.

IMPORTANT: Before anything, if you didn't know, ONLY take BlackMageMod.tmod to the Mods folder, or else shit's gonna mess up. Also, you need the Cheat Sheet mod to access it as "Black Mage Hat" (yeah i know, i couldn't make a recipe because im a dumbass)

Now then, some things I like to do for the cosplay is use Reflective Obsidian Dye for everything and use any of the four robes. For the clothes underneath I would recommend using the same dye that you used for the robe as to give the same look (hi im captain obvious). An optional thing you can do is get Yellow Dye and that Fire Gauntlet for the classic yellow hands look.

Have fun with my mod, thank you for downloading!!
